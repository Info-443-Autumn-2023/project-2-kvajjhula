We decided to choose Modelio for our Project 2. Modelio is an open-source modeling tool and modeling environment designed for different software engineering activities. Modelio is a software system that facilitates the creation, analysis, and management of various models such as UML diagrams, BPMN diagrams, Java, Python, and more. Users can use Modelio to visually design and document software architectures, data models, etc. It provides a simplified, user-friendly interface for collaborative modeling, code generation, integration and other software development tools. Modelio is a valuable resource for software developers, system architects, and business analysts who wish to improve their modeling and design processes. This open-source software was created by Modeliosoft, based in Paris, France.
